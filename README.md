# Pi Insights

Personal usage analytics for the [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Scans your session history, extracts deterministic stats and LLM-powered facets, then generates a self-contained HTML report covering your workflows, friction points, and suggestions for improvement.

Built by the [Observal](https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/Observal) team while developing our agent observability platform. We needed to understand how we actually use Pi across hundreds of sessions, what patterns emerge, and where we waste time or money. This extension is the result.

## Install

**From npm** (recommended):

```bash
pi install npm:@observal/pi-insights
```

**From source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BlazeUp-AI/pi-insights.git
pi install ./pi-insights
```

**Try without installing:**

```bash
pi -e npm:@observal/pi-insights
```

## Usage

Run the command inside any Pi session:

```
/pi-insights
```

The report opens in your browser automatically.

### Report Sections

- **Summary** of what is working, what is hindering you, quick wins, and ambitious workflows
- **What Changed This Week** showing cost, errors, and model shifts compared to last week
- **By the Numbers** with tokens, cost, lines changed, tool usage, and response time distributions
- **Where You Worked** grouped by project
- **How You Work** analysis of your interaction patterns
- **Wins** with your most impressive workflows
- **Where Things Broke** split into resolved friction (wins) and ongoing friction (with severity)
- **Next Steps** including config additions, features to try, usage patterns with copyable prompts, and things to stop doing
- **Future Workflows** for ambitious opportunities as models improve
- **Model Spend** showing overspend, underspend, cost breakdown by model, and estimated waste

### What Makes This Different

Most Pi insight extensions dump flat aggregates into an LLM prompt and get the same generic report every time. This one is temporal-aware:

- **Week-over-week diffs**: see what actually changed, not a static portrait
- **Trajectory detection**: are your costs/errors improving, worsening, or stable?
- **Anomaly detection**: spikes in cost or errors are surfaced with context
- **Resolved vs ongoing friction**: only surfaces problems you still have, not ones you fixed
- **Context-aware suggestions**: reads your existing AGENTS.md, installed skills, extensions, and packages. Will not suggest what you already have.
- **Negative suggestions**: tells you what to stop doing, not just what to add

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--refresh` / `-r` | Invalidate all cached LLM facet extractions and re-run them |
| `--no-open` | Generate the report without opening it in the browser |

### Examples

```bash
# Normal run (uses caches, fast on re-runs)
/pi-insights

# Force re-extraction of all session facets
/pi-insights --refresh

# Generate without auto-opening
/pi-insights --no-open
```

## How It Works

The pipeline runs in five phases:

1. **Scan** all Pi session log files
2. **Extract stats** deterministically from each session (tool counts, tokens, languages, git activity, response times)
3. **LLM facet extraction** per session to classify goals, outcomes, satisfaction, and friction
4. **Aggregate with temporal weighting**, compute diffs, detect anomalies and transitions, gather user context
5. **Generate insights** using 8 parallel LLM prompts (with temporal and user context injected) plus a synthesis prompt, then **render** a self-contained HTML report

Results are cached in `~/.pi/agent/usage-data/`:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `session-meta/<id>.json` | Deterministic stats, cached permanently |
| `facets/<id>.json` | LLM-extracted facets, cached permanently (clear with `--refresh`) |
| `report.html` | Last generated report |

## Requirements

- [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) v0.74.0 or later
- An active model configured in Pi (used for both facet extraction and insight generation)
